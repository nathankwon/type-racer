A typing game tutorial:
(Traversy Media) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw-SYSG-028

Initialise application by typing `index.html` into the console.

Additions/changes implemented:
  * Added colors to success/game over message
  * Added 'typing' message to prevent surrounding items from bouncing around while user types
  * Added difficulty Selector on ui (previously could only be manipulated via the js file)

Additional Thoughts:
  * Refactoring with a css file would be neater, but the application is simple enough to warrant not using one.
