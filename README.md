Build a typing game tutorial:
(Traversy Media) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw-SYSG-028

Initialise application by typing `index.html`

// Thoughts on what to update in Readme
  // What the tutorial added
  // Additions/changes implemented
  // Possible improvements/additions
    * Words Per Minute (WPM)
    * New Game button instead of typing last uncompleted word
    * Difficulty Selector on ui (currently exists in js file)
    * Capitalisation (should it matter???)
