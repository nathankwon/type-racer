Build a typing game tutorial:
(Traversy Media) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw-SYSG-028

Initialise application by typing `index.html`

// Thoughts on what to update in Readme
  // What the tutorial features were(?)
  // Additions/changes implemented
    * Added colors to success/game over message
    * Added difficulty Selector on ui (previously only existed in js file)
  // Possible improvements/additions
    * Words Per Minute (WPM)
    * New Game button instead of typing last uncompleted word?
    * Capitalisation (should it matter???)
  // Additional Thoughts
    * Refactor with css file would be neater, but the application is simple enough to warrant not using one.

    TODO
    Make message not bump around during game over
